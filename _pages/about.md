Hey! This is Yichen Wang (Zach çŽ‹å¥•è¾°) from XJTU. Thank you for visiting!

**I am looking for a Ph.D. position in NLP/HCI/IRðŸ˜ƒ!**

I am a **senior undergrad** at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) (XJTU) in the CS Honors Program, currently interning at [UW NLP](https://www.cs.washington.edu/research/nlp/) with [Tianxing He](https://cloudygoose.github.io/) and Prof. [Yulia Tsvetkov](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yuliats/). I've exchanged to UC Berkeley, working with [Kevin Yang](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yangk/) and Prof. [Dan Klein](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~klein/) within [Berkeley NLP](https://nlp.cs.berkeley.edu/). At XJTU, I've been mentored by Prof. [Xiaoming Liu](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/xm.liu/home) and Prof. [Chao Shen](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/cshen/english) for over two years. Also, I stay in close contact with Prof. [Minnan Luo](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/minnluo) and Prof. [Xinyu Dai](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/daixinyu/index.htm) ([NLP Lab, NJU](http://nlp.nju.edu.cn/homepage/index.html)).

I am primarily interested in **human-LLM interaction** on evaluation and generation, **planning in controlled generation**, and **LLM safety concerns** (e.g., machine-generated text detection, watermarking, and stress testing). Beyond these, I am also actively exploring **alignment** and **agents**.
<!-- Primarily focused on **machine-generated text detection**, **automatic evaluation** of semantics, and **controlled generation and planning** within the broader NLP field. I am also actively working on **AI safety** concerns, including **watermark** generation and **robustness** to attacks. Beyond these, I hold a keen interest in **agents**, and evaluation and enhancement for **human-LLM interaction**, such as RLHF in **alignment**. -->

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at *yichenwg[at]gmail[dot]com* ! :wink:

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
