The website is under construction now!

I am a **senior undergrad** at Xi'an Jiaotong University in the CS Honors Program, currently interning at UW NLP with Tianxing He and Prof. Yulia Tsvetkov. I've exchanged to UC Berkeley, working with Kevin Yang and Prof. Dan Klein within Berkeley NLP. At XJTU, I've be researching with Prof. Xiaoming Liu and Prof. Chao Shen for over two years.

My research interests primarily revolve around **machine-generated text detection**, **automatic evaluation**, and **controlled generation** enhancement via my discovery from evaluation in reverse. Additionally, I am actively working on **NLP safety concerns**, i.e., watermarking on LLM, robustness to attacks, extending detection to HCI evaluation, and exploring the **interpretation** of detection.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
